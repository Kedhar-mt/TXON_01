            <h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
            <p>Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, Kohli is known for his aggressive batting style, excellent fitness, and outstanding leadership skills.
                Kohli started playing cricket at a young age and made his debut for the Indian cricket team in August 2008. He made an immediate impact in his debut match, scoring 12 runs off just 22 balls. However, it was his performance in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup that made him a household name in India. He played a crucial role in India's victory in the tournament, scoring 282 runs at an average of 35.25.
                Since then, Kohli has gone from strength to strength, establishing himself as one of the most consistent batsmen in the world. He has a phenomenal record in all three formats of the game, having scored over 12,000 runs in ODIs, 7,600 runs in Tests, and over 3,000 runs in T20Is. He has also scored over 70 international centuries, the most by an Indian cricketer.</p>
